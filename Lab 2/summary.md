i got the dataset off of •	Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets which is in a csv format, 
"This dataset contains synthetic daily internet usage records segmented across different age groups. It captures how users allocate their online time among social media, work or study, and entertainment activities. Additionally, the dataset includes information about the primary device used and the type of internet connection.

The dataset is clean, structured, and designed for beginners and intermediate users to practice exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and machine learning tasks."
i did:
•	Load the dataset
•	Display its shape
•	Preview the first few rows
•	Check column names and data types

and am working with this as a classification problem
