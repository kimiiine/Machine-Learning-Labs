The dataset used in this project consists of labeled images of plant leaves, organized into two categories: Healthy leaves and Infected leaves. Each image represents a visual sample of a leaf, and the dataset is structured into folders where each folder name corresponds to its class label. In total, the dataset contains a small number of images suitable for introductory machine learning experimentation.
