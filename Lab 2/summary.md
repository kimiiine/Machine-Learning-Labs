i got the dataset off of •	UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu
it is about students enrolled in different undergraduate degrees, such as agronomy, design, education, nursing, journalism, management, social service, and technologies. The dataset includes information known at the time of student enrollment (academic path, demographics, and social-economic factors) and the students' academic performance at the end of the first and second semesters.
i did:
•	Load the dataset
•	Display its shape
•	Preview the first few rows
•	Check column names and data types
